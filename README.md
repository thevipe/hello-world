My name is tyler i am a gamer who is working on learning more about android rom building and i am currently working on my own build of an unoffical lineage os 14.1.2 build for the samsung galaxy tab 4 sm-t530nu and im going to enable the IR Blaster for it and maybe work on the other sm-t530, sm-t535. etc i dont have those devices but i will try to build them as well but i need to work on my tablet first to get the basics down before i can move on to any other device.
